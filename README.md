###Climbing Gyms in Taiwan

An app to show information on climbing gyms. Filter by type of gym. Check out the map on how to get there. Objective is for an app to have it easy for someone new to climbing or someone who has just come to Taiwan to find a good gym close to them. Ideas for development could include adding a server and having user inputted gyms. However currently there aren't that many climbing gyms in Taiwan so it could be all manually added by the developer for now.

###Development

```bash
$ npm install
$ react-native run-ios
```

Alternatively after the `npm install`, open the xcode project in ios > climbTaiwan.xcodeProject and run it.
